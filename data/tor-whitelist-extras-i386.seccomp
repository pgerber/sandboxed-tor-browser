# tor binary i386 specific seccomp rules that will be installed in addition to
# tor-whitelist-seccomp.

# tor's sandbox code claims that these calls are required on x86 but not on
# x86_64.  tor's sandbox attempts to filter socketcall's arguments as well
# when it adds a rule, but seccomp on x86 does not support argument filtering,
# and I suspect that the arg filter is incorrect.
